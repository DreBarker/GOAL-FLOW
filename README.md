Building GOAL FLOW: A Full-Stack Accountability Platform

Introduction

As a junior developer who recently completed a backend course, I wanted to practice CRUD operations in a fun and practical way. Instead of building a simple and straight forward CRUD operation app like to-do list etc, I decided to challenge myself further by creating GOAL FLOW—a full-stack web application where users can search and follow friends, post intended activities, receive support through comments, and track their progress.

GOAL FLOW serves as an accountability platform, helping users stay motivated by sharing their goals with close friends who can encourage them in the comments.The platform is built for individuals who struggle with procrastination, providing a social environment where motivation and support drive productivity. The cartoonish look and feel of the UI makes GOAL FLOW a more exciting platform to visit daily. Users can also mark activities as completed and bookmark posts to track ongoing activities or activities they find inspirational or relevant.

Features of GOAL FLOW
	1.	User Accounts & Friend System
	•	Users can create accounts and follow friends to see their activity updates.
       •     Users can edit their profile, change their display name, add a brief description of themselves and add profile picture from a list of available Avatars.
	•	A personalized feed shows posts from followed users.
	2.	Activity Posting & Support System
	•	Users can post activities they want to complete.
	•	Friends can comment on posts to provide encouragement and support.
	3.	Completion Tracking
	•	Users can mark activities as “completed,” and their followers can see their progress.
	4.	Bookmarking System
	•	Users can bookmark posts to keep track of their friends’ ongoing activities.
       5. Explore Ongoing activities from other users.
	•	Users can explore/discover other ongoing activities from other users that are not necessarily followed. 

Tech Stack

Frontend
	•	EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates) for dynamic rendering.
	•	CSS for styling.
	•	JavaScript for interactivity.

Backend
	•	Node.js with Express.js to handle server logic and API requests.
	•	PostgreSQL as the database to store users, posts, comments, and bookmarks.

Authentication & Security
	•	Passport Authentication for secure user sessions.
	•	Bcrypt.js for password encryption.

Development Process
	1.	Planning & Wireframing
	•	Outlined user flow and interface design before development.
	2.	Backend Development
	•	Created RESTful API endpoints for authentication, posts, comments, and bookmarks.
	3.	Frontend Development
	•	Built a dynamic UI using EJS templates and styled it with CSS.
	4.	Integration & Testing
	•	Connected the frontend and backend, ensuring smooth CRUD operations.
	5.	Project Completion
	•	The project is not deployed yet, but the code is available on my GitHub for anyone interested.

Conclusion

GOAL FLOW was a great way for me to practice backend development beyond simple projects. It allowed me to work with authentication, database management, and real-world CRUD operations while making a useful tool for accountability.

If you’d like to check out the code, you can find it on my GitHub!

Of course there are lots of features that can be added to enhance the general experience of GOAL FLOW but the motivation behind this project was to challenge myself as a new developer to put into practice what I have learnt and also learn more. I am glad I did this project because I learnt a lot of things. I look forward to taking on more personal projects to keep leaning more.
